        <h1>Why Students?</h1>
        <p>For us at Project Inspire, our ultimate aim is to upskill the new generation to be able to think in new and creative ways, and we want to stretch their minds in new ways, so they can learn and grow through this process.</p>
        <p>We hope that by doing this, we not only help students, but we spread STEM to less fortunate places, and be able to upskill this generation wth new ideas.</p>

                        <h1>The Program</h1>
                        <p >Over the three day student course, students are immersed a program which simulates a real world scenario, and over the course of the 3 days, they are guided through problem solving steps and allowed to ask questions and reinvent their former ways of thinking. </p>
                        <p>Our programs may vary depeding on the age group at hand, and will always in volve hands on experience.</p>
                        <h1>How it works</h1>
                        <p>If you want to see these program run at your school, find our contact page, and we will talk through in further detail about how we can collaborate well with your school.</p>
                        <p>Depending on the skills and tools the students want to be engaged with, there are different programs within the STEM field</p>

                        <p>Project Inspire runs 3 main courses; Coding, Engineering and CAD.</p>
                        <p><strong>Coding - </strong></p>
                        <p> For this segment of STEM, we have a program which allows students to engage with hands on activities that codes a game, which then can be applied to real life. We also have a segment called "computerless computing" in which we have created activities that give student the opportunity to gain a greater understanding of how computer "brains" work, and this thinking can be applied to their programming.</p>

                        <p><strong>Engineering - </p>
                            <p></strong>For this strand, we run a course which spans over 3 days, and it gets students to engineer a solution to a given problem, and present solutions on the final day. Through similar activities, students will improve both their creative thinking, but also their collaborative, leadership, teamwork and time management skills.</p>
                            <p><strong>Computer Aided Design - </strong></p>
                             <p> CAD, or Computer Aided Design is used throughout the tech industry on a wide scale basis, and this program will run students through the basiscs of how CAD works, its functions, and prepare them for their future endeavours when using CAD. Our specific program runs through CAD's basic functions and where it can be applied to in the work force. </p>
