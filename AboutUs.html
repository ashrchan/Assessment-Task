    <h1>What is STEM</h1>
    <p>STEM - standing for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - is a relatively new strand of learning
        within the education system, and its aim is to explore and incorporate these subjects into the curriculum, as it
        provides students with problem solving and critical thinking skills in ways that other subjects do not. With
        recent developments in technology, the education sector has not caught up with recent advancements, so our aim
        is to aid the STEM movement by teaching everyone about it. </p>

                <p>With STEM being a new facet of the education system, but with its exponential growth within the
                    world's job oppotunity and innovations stage, we discovered many thousands of educational
                    institutions still have not made the change to cope with this ever evolving technology.</p>

                <p>We all have backgrounds in STEM, and had excellent mentors growing up, and were involved in a program
                    called FIRST robotics, which intruduced us to STEM in one of the best ways. </p>

                    belive in education being the means of creative thinking, and new ideas. With these new ideas, the

                <p>We believe that the best way to inform is to educate, but in the most exciting ways possible, which
                    means truly getting students to understand concepts through first hand experience. We say although
                    learning theory is good, to really engage and play around in subjects, students tend to engage more
                    with practical learning.</p>
