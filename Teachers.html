    <h1>Our aim -</h1>
    <p>With STEM being a new facet of the education system, but with its exponential growth within the world's job oppotunity and innovations stage, we discovered many thousands of educational institutions still have not made the change to cope with this ever evolving technology. The teachers program we have set up intends to solve this problem, with the intention of upskilling teachers with the technological tools and skills to be able to teach their students, and also gain knowledge about this new Science and Technology platform.</p>

                    <p >The teacher program we have set up runs over 2 days, and teaches teachers the basics of STEM, and its aim to create a learning environment for teachers to learn about STEM, and teach them the best ways to teach STEM to their students.</p>
                    <h1> The Program - Day 1 </h1>
                    <p> The course runs for 3 days, with Day 1 being an introduction to the basics of Coding, and using programs such as Scratch and Hopscotch, and then later, looking at other programming languages such as Python and Java to see their applications and uses.</p>

                    <h1>Day 2</h1>
                    <p>Day 2 consists of learning about CAD and its uses, and then a basic structure as to what teachers should be teaching students, and examples of STEM activities that can be applied to everyday lessons. The programs they will be using are called Fusion360 and Onshape, which are basic CAD programs with an easier-to-use interface than other CAD's int he industry. Project Inspire hopes that this will encourage teachers to learn on their own, and figure out how CAD can be applied in their lives.</p>

                    <p> Day 3 is Project Day, where teachers will use allt he concepts learnt in the previous days, and compile it into a lesson to present at the end of day 3. The idea is that after this, teachers can go away have a better understading of how STEM can be incorporated into daily activities, and Project Inspire hopes that this program sees teachers start teaching students to prepare them for their STEM filled</p>
